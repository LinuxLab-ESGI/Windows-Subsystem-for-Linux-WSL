## What is the WSL and how it works ?

The WSL for **W**indows **S**ubsystem for **L**inux is a compatibility layer developed by Microsoft for running Linux binaries natively (ELF format) in a console environment on Windows 10 and Windows 11. This ingenious technology provides a Linux-compatible kernel interface and can interact directly with the windows operating system. Moreover, it allows a user to chose a Linux distribution to install from the Microsoft Store (more info in below).
